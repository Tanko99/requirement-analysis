## Requirement Analysis In Software Development
---
## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis refers to a phase in software development life-cycle (SDLC) where the project team identifies, analyzes, gathers and defines the requirements needed for the software product to be developed. There are usually two kinds of requirements which are; functional and non-functional requirements 

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement analysis is important because of the following reasons;
- It enhances clarity and understamdimg within the team ensuring the goals of the stakeholders are achieved.
- It prevents scope creep which are uncontrolled changes in requirements.
- Requirement minimizes and enhance time efficiency by ensuring  that only needed features are built.
- Test cases and quality assurance processes are derived from a well-documented requirement analysis ensuring verifcation and validtion of each feature for high-quality produt.
- Makes it easier to track and manage changes in requirement.
- Tracebility: meaning that  it provides a traceble link between requirements and implentation.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

## üß© 1. Requirement Gathering
- Involves collecting initial information from stakeholders (clients, users, managers).
-  Often done through interviews, questionnaires, brainstorming sessions, and market research.
-  Helps identify the basic goals, needs, and problems the system should solve.
-  Ensures early stakeholder involvement to avoid confusion later.
-  May include studying existing systems or documents for reference.

## üïµÔ∏è 2. Requirement Elicitation
Focuses on extracting deep, detailed, and hidden requirements.
Uses techniques like:
- Workshops
- Observation (job shadowing)
- Use case analysis
- Prototyping
- Addresses implicit needs, assumptions, and domain-specific constraints.
- Often requires conflict resolution between contradictory stakeholder inputs.
- Helps refine vague ideas into actionable requirements.

## üìÑ 3. Requirement Documentation
Involves formally recording all gathered and elicited requirements.
Usually compiled into a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
Types of documentation:
- Functional requirements (what the system does)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
- Use cases, user stories, acceptance criteria
- Creates a reference point for developers, testers, and clients.
- Should be clear, unambiguous, complete, and consistent.

## üîç 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Involves breaking down and understanding the structure, priority, and feasibility of requirements.Activities include:
- Identifying dependencies and conflicts
- Prioritizing requirements
- Checking for completeness and clarity
  
**Often uses models and diagrams:**
- Use case diagrams
- Data flow diagrams (DFD)
- Entity-relationship diagrams (ERD)
- Translates requirements into a format suitable for system design and architecture.

## ‚úÖ 5. Requirement Validation
Ensures that requirements are:
- Correct ‚Äì meet business needs
- Complete ‚Äì cover all functionalities
- Consistent ‚Äì free from contradictions
- Feasible ‚Äì technically and financially viable
  
**Techniques used:**
- Reviews (peer, walkthroughs, inspections)
- Prototypes and mockups
- Client sign-off meetings
- Helps eliminate errors early, reducing cost and rework in later stages.
- Leads to final approval before the design phase begins.
